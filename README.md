This is cub3D, a small Wolfenstein3D-like game without enemies, weapons and any goal or purpose.
Basically, all you can do is just walk around.

How do I play?

1. Run "make".
2. ./cub3D map_name.

  ./cub3D map_name --save
will save a screenshot in .bmp format.

It will be saved in the same folder the map is located.


I've prepared some textures in the "textures" folder.
There are some pre-configured maps too
(try guessing the name of the folder, lol).

Note: maps should have the ".cub" file extension.

Enjoy!!!
