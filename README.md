This is cub3D, a small Wolfenstein3D-like game without enemies, weapons and any goal or purpose.
Basically, all you can do is just walk around.

## How do I play?

1. Run `make`.
2. `./cub3D map_name`.

## Oh, and you can save a screenshot of the first frame!
`./cub3D map_name --save`
will save a screenshot in .bmp format.

It will be saved in the directory of the map.


I've prepared some textures in the "textures" folder.
There are some pre-configured maps too
(try guessing the name of the folder, lol).

Note: maps should have the ".cub" file extension.

Enjoy!!!
